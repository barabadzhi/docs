## Setup

:::info
Make sure you have TypeScript installed on your computer. To install TypeScript globally, use the command below:
```bash
npm install -g typescript
```
:::

To begin, let's initiate a new Webpack + TypeScript project from scratch:

1. Let's create an empty directory first:
```bash
mkdir my-novorender-app
```
Navigate into the newly created directory and then proceed with the following commands to complete the project creation process:

2. Create a `package.json` file with sane defaults:
```bash npm2yarn
npm init -y
```

3. Install the required packages:
```bash npm2yarn  
npm install -D webpack webpack-cli ts-loader webpack-dev-server copy-webpack-plugin html-webpack-plugin
```

### Configuring Webpack
In this step, we'll configure Webpack with some basic configuration to transpile the project with Typescript.

Create a file named `webpack.config.js` in the root directory and paste the following code:
```javascript title="webpack.config.js"
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
    entry: './src/main.ts',
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.ts?$/,
                use: 'ts-loader',
                exclude: /node_modules/,
            }
        ],
    },
    resolve: {
        extensions: ['.ts', '.js'],
    },
    plugins: [
        new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
            template: 'index.html'
        }),
    ],
    devServer: {
        client: {
            overlay: {
                warnings: false,
            }
        }
    },
};
```
:::note
In addition to the Webpack configuration (which is pretty much self-explanatory), you might have noticed that we're setting `devServer.client.overlay.warnings` to `false`. This setting is necessary because Webpack may produce warnings related to dynamic imports within the `@novorender/api`, which can be displayed as overlay warnings on the browser viewport. However, by setting this value to `false`, we prevent these warnings from appearing on the browser screen while still being able to view them in the developer console for debugging purposes. This adjustment helps maintain a cleaner and less cluttered development experience.
:::

#### Adding Build Commands:
Open `package.json` and add the following commands to `scripts`, we'll use these later to run the development server and to bundle the project:
```json title="package.json"
"dev": "webpack-dev-server --mode development --open",
"build": "webpack --mode production"
```

### Installing Web API
Run the following command to install the Novorender Web API package:
```bash npm2yarn
npm i --save @novorender/api
```
The NPM package contains pre-built [ESM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) bundles for the main script and worker scripts as well as the binary resource dependencies. We removed support for legacy UMD modules.
:::info
A copy of all the original typescript source code along with sourcemaps is included too. We consider the source code an important part of our documentation.
:::
Besides installing the package, you must make sure the files in the `public/` directory of this package are available to your server, this is covered in next section.

### Copying required resources
Before we move forward to actually implementing the Novorender Web API, we need to find some way to copy the resources from `node_modules/@novorender/api/public`, let's use [CopyWebpackPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/copy-webpack-plugin/) to accomplish this.

Put the following code into `webpack.config.js`:
```javascript title="webpack.config.js"
// import the copy plugin
const CopyPlugin = require("copy-webpack-plugin");

...
// add into into `plugins` array:
new CopyPlugin({
    patterns: [
        { from: "node_modules/@novorender/api/public/*", to: "novorender/api/[name][ext]" }
    ]
}),
...
```

### Server requirements

Our API uses advanced, cutting edge javascript APIs, many of which comes with certain security requirements. In general, the following two global properties have to be true: [`isSecureContext`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/isSecureContext) and [`crossOriginIsolated`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/crossOriginIsolated).

To make it all work, your server has to ensure:

1. A [secure context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts). In practice, this means HTTP on localhost (for debugging only) and HTTPS everywhere else, including LAN.

2. Cross origin [HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer#security_requirements) for *top level documents*.
```http
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

This can be done by adding the following headers in Webpack config file's `devServer` object.
```javascript title="webpack.config.js"
...
devServer: {
      headers: {
          "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy": "same-origin",
          "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy": "require-corp",
      }
},
...
```

:::info
It's important to note that the method described above for enabling Cross-Origin headers is primarily intended for development mode. When transitioning to a production environment, you will need to configure these headers on your server. The specific implementation will depend on the server you are using, so please consult the relevant documentation for detailed instructions.
:::


3. MIME type [`text/javascript`](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/text/javascript) for javascript files and [`application/wasm`](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/wasm) for web assembly files.

4. Any resources loaded from a separate domain has be configured with [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) to allow your domain.

5. Service workers script at the appropriate location, preferably at the root of your domain. See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerContainer/register) for more.

### Typescript

Using our APIs from javascript is possible but *strongly discouraged*. We rely heavily on typescript to help users catch common errors at edit/compile time. Technical support will only be provided for typescript users.

This package is built using version <WebApiTypescriptVersion /> of typescript. As a rule of thumb, you should upgrade to the latest version of typescript whenever a new version is released.

If you plan to do your own bundling and use our sources directly, you may want to use our `tsconfig.json` as a baseline for your own:

```jsonc
{
  "extends": "node_modules/@novorender/api/tsconfig.json", // or wherever...
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
  }
}
```

We generally use `ESNext` as target since we only support latest version of browsers with cutting edge support for 3D rendering. Also, we use relatively new typescript features such as [`verbatimModuleSyntax`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#verbatimModuleSyntax) and [`allowArbitraryExtensions`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#allowArbitraryExtensions).


## Writing some code
Now that we have a proper project in place, we can go ahead implementing the actual API.

### Providing required resources 
Before we create a [view](https://docs.novorender.com/docs/guides/views), we need to provide it with some [resources](https://docs.novorender.com/docs/guides/views#prerequisites);
- Canvas
- Device profile
- Imports

These resources are crucial for setting up and configuring the view properly.

#### Canvas
To begin, let's create an HTML canvas element, create `index.html` file in the root directory and paste the following:
```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My Novorender App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <canvas id="canvas" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; background-color: greenyellow"></canvas>
  </body>
</html>
```
:::info
It's crucial to set the CSS `width` and `height` properties on the canvas element to prevent runaway resize feedback loops. This ensures that the canvas has the correct dimensions and behaves as expected.
:::

Then, create a working directory called `/src` in the root of the project. Inside this directory, add a new file named `main.ts`. Then, insert the following code into `main.ts` to obtain a reference to the canvas element we previously created:
```typescript title="main.ts"
const canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
```

#### Device profile
Get the device profile:
```typescript title="main.ts"
import { getDeviceProfile } from "@novorender/api";

const gpuTier = 2;
const deviceProfile = getDeviceProfile(gpuTier);
```

#### Imports
[Remember](#providing-required-resources) we copied some resources from `@novorender/api/public` dir? that's where they come into play.
```typescript title="main.ts"
import { View } from "@novorender/api";
// @ts-expect-error
import { shaders } from "@novorender/api/public/shaders";

const baseUrl = new URL("/novorender/api/", location.origin);
const imports = await View.downloadImports({ baseUrl, shaders });
```
:::info
Did you notice the `// @ts-expect-error` comment? This is essential because Webpack might incorrectly assume that the `@novorender/api` doesn't expose this module, even though it does and this will tell TypeScript to suppress that error from being reported.
:::

### Creating View
With all the necessary components in place, we can proceed to create and run our view:
```typescript title="main.ts"
import { View } from "@novorender/api";

const view = new View(canvas, deviceProfile, imports);
await view.run();
```

Finally, call the <CodeLink type="class" name="view.dispose" /> method to clean up the view's GPU resources.
```typescript title="main.ts"
view.dispose();
```

Let's consolidate all the steps and components we've discussed and see the result:
```typescript title="main.ts"
import { View, getDeviceProfile } from "@novorender/api";
// @ts-expect-error
import { shaders } from "@novorender/api/public/shaders";
const canvas = document.getElementById("canvas") as HTMLCanvasElement;

async function main(canvas: HTMLCanvasElement) {
    const gpuTier = 2;
    const deviceProfile = getDeviceProfile(gpuTier);
    const baseUrl = new URL("/novorender/api/", location.origin);
    const imports = await View.downloadImports({ baseUrl, shaders });
    const view = new View(canvas, deviceProfile, imports);
    await view.run();
    view.dispose();
}

main(canvas);
```

:::tip
Avoid [deep imports](https://gist.github.com/daleyjem/0f38f561a4e91e58eba580889f38330f)! Everything you need should be available from the package root: `@novorender/api`.
:::

Start the development server by running the following command:
```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

Upon successful execution, you should now see an image with a subtle gray gradient:
![application screenshot initial view](/img/guides/tutorial-001.png)

Let's make it a little more interactive by modifying `renderState` and adding a <CodeLink type="interface" name="RenderStateGrid" />.
```typescript title="main.ts"
...
const view = new View(canvas, deviceProfile, imports);
view.modifyRenderState({ grid: { enabled: true } });
await view.run();
...
```
![application screenshot grid view](/img/guides/tutorial-002.png)
:::info
You can learn more about the `RenderState` [here](/docs/web_api/Interfaces/interface.RenderState) and experiment with it by adding or modifying some of its properties. This will help you better understand how to customize rendering behaviors.
:::
:::tip
The view already has camera controller built in so you can interact with the view by holding down the left-click on your mouse or trackpad. Alternatively, you can use the movement keys and <kbd>W</kbd><kbd>A</kbd><kbd>S</kbd><kbd>D</kbd> to navigate and move the camera around in the view.
:::
:::info
The view will automatically resize your canvas' pixel size when the css layout and/or the render state output settings changes.
