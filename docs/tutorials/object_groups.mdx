Although the [ObjectGroup interface](../data-js-api/interfaces/DataJsAPI.ObjectGroup) itself is not particulary noteworthy,
the [SceneData.objectGroups property](../interfaces/DataJsAPI.SceneData#objectgroups) can be extremely useful. 
Object IDs in Novorender are not fixed and may change whenever the scene's resources are modified. 
Therefore if you store the IDs from a search (e.g. all objects on the first floor) and then later modify the scene's resources, 
the scene's objects' IDs may have changed and your stored list of IDs will be stale.  

The search patterns assigned to each object group is run every time a scene's resources are modified so that the list of IDs always will be correct.
That way you can easily create cached searches by using object groups.

In the case where the `objectGroups.ids` list is quite large, the .ids property is undefined and should be explicity loaded as shown in the [Floors example](#floors-example).

## Modify groups

Edit a group
```typescript
  // Load scene data
  const sceneData = await dataApi.loadScene(SCENE_ID);
  // ID of group to edit
  const toEdit = "56196cbf-f5aa-4f65-9934-911546f89225";
  // Create new array with the changes applied.
  // In this case name is set to "Updated name"
  const updatedGroups = sceneData.objectGroups.map((group) =>
    group.id === toEdit ? { ...group, name: "Updated name" } : group
  );

  // Save scene
  dataApi.putScene({
    ...sceneData,
    url: `${SCENE_ID}:${scene.id}`,
    objectGroups: updatedGroups,
  });
```

Delete a group
```typescript
  // Load scene data
  const sceneData = await dataApi.loadScene(SCENE_ID);
  // ID of group to delete
  const toDelete = "56196cbf-f5aa-4f65-9934-911546f89225";
  // Create new array without the group to delete
  const updatedGroups = sceneData.objectGroups.filter(
    (group) => group.id !== toDelete
  );

  // Save scene
  dataApi.putScene({
    ...sceneData,
    url: `${SCENE_ID}:${scene.id}`,
    objectGroups: updatedGroups,
  });
```

## Floors example

In this example we have predefined groups which are set up for each floor and created buttons to isolate object for the clicked floor button.
