NovoRender measure API can be used to draw mesure entity or results into a 2d canvas.
It can be used with utility functions found in the open source Novoweb [github repository](https://github.com/novorender/novoweb/blob/develop/src/features/engine2D/utils.ts)
The functions that draws to the canvas is placed in the frontend code to make it easy for developers to change the style of 2d rawings to fit their own application

### Draw entites

Many objects returned from the measure API contains a `drawkind`, as long as the retunred value contains this value then it can be drawn using `getDrawMeasureEntity()`.
`getDrawMeasureEntity()` found in the measure API will returned a hierarchical set of objects that be used to draw to screen.
The objects contains both 3d and 2d data and various information about drawing types, names, display text and more.
The function will require `view` from the NovoRender webgl-API to transform the 3d data to 2d.
The camera from webgl-API view is also used in the draw utility to remove certain drawing parts and text based on camera angle and distance

:::note
Check the parametric measure tutorial on how to select measure entites.
:::

```typescript
  const entity = await measureScene.pickMeasureEntity(objectId, position);
  const drawProd = await measureApi.getDrawMeasureEntity(view, measureScene, entity);
  const camSettings = { pos: camera.position, dir: cameraDirection };
  const { camera } = view;
  if (drawProd) {
    //Function found in the utility ts file
    drawProduct(context2D,
                camSettings,
                drawProd,
                { lineColor: "yellow", fillColor: measurementFillColor, complexCylinder: true },
                3)
  }
}
```

### Draw measure result

The measure result also contains `drawKind` and can be drawn using `getDrawMeasureEntity()`.
The result will contain information on how to draw the measure line, x, y and z dimensions of the measurement as well as certain angles.
The result object can be drawn using the utility `drawProduct()` as above but we have chosen to handle each part of the result seperatly to give more flexibility on style and colour.

Exaple shows distance line drawn in blue, the z-axis line and angle drawn in green

```typescript
const measureResult = await measurescene.measure(entity1, entity2);
const drawProd = await measureApi.getDrawMeasureEntity(
  view,
  measureScene,
  measureResult
);
for (const obj of drawProd.objects) {
  for (const part of obj.parts) {
    if (part.vertices2D === undefined) {
      continue;
    }
    switch (part.name) {
      case "result":
        drawPart(context2D, camSettings, part, { lineColor: "blue" }, 3, {
          type: "distance",
        });
        break;
      case "z-axis":
        drawPart(context2D, camSettings, part, { lineColor: "green" }, 3, {
          type: "distance",
        });
        break;
      case "z-angle":
        drawPart(context2D, camSettings, part, { lineColor: "green" }, 2, {
          type: "distance",
        });
        break;
    }
  }
}
```

### Demo

Click to select parametric object, the selected parametric object will be draw, do note that a point will be drawn if the selected object does not contain parmetric info.
Click another object to measure against, the paremetric object will be drawm as well as the measure result.
Continued clicks will alternate between objects and log out the measurement values.

The draw utility functions discussed in the tutorial are added at the bottom of the demo.
