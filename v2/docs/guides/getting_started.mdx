## Live examples

A picture says more than a thousand words and a demo more than a thousand pictures.
This is why we include plenty of interactive examples that you navigate in real time and also edit the code live to see what happens.
To keep each example short and to the point, they all run in some sort of context where things like a view has already been created and simply being passed as a parameter.
Since we're not actually running a build system, your import options are limited to our API and related apis, such as `gl-matrix`.
While you can insert any code you like and experiment quite a lot, the purpose of examples are merely to do minor tweaks, like changing values or changing different parameters.

> Take care not to change the module shape, i.e. don't change the exported function names or parameters!

This example shows a minialistic implementation to get anything on screen.
There's not much there, but you can actually do quite a bit within the scope of this particular example.
We'll dive into that later.

<PlaygroundComponent {...snippets.gettingStarted["Basic"]} />

## Example scopes

Most examples will have a more limited scope where the view is already created and some state set.
These examples will typically take other parameters.
The example below takes no parameter and simply returns changes to the <CodeLink type="interface" name="RenderState"/>, which describes what the rendering should look like.

Try changing the the values in the example below!

<PlaygroundComponent {...snippets.gettingStarted["Render State"]} />

We limit the scope of many examples to keep the code short and focus on the subject at hand.
Also, every time you make a code change, the example code is re-executed, with a tear-down and initialization phase.
Recreating certain resources, like background environment, view and scenes can take time and be resource intensive.
Hence, they are best kept outside where they only need be created once.

We use Microsoft's [Monaco editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/), which is quite powerful and helpful for editing typescript code.
Try hovering your mouse over some of the properties and see how the documentation pops up!
Also notice how auto completion makes it easy to add new code.

> Pro tip: Trying use `ctrl+space' to prompt the editor to make suggestions related to where the cursor is placed!
